# Behaviour

> Inflator uses a loosely [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip "python package manager") inspired syntax.

!!! Note

    Inflator will try to behave like the old [backpack](https://github.com/aspizu/backpack "Package manager by aspizu")
    version when dealing with `goboscript.toml`.
    In the future, it will probably not support the current backpack version/syntax.

Inflator looks for an `inflator.toml` file when looking for config and dependencies.
It is similar to goboscript's `goboscript.toml` file.
